ACCESS.MD is a mobile and web app to allow medical providers to get their IT infrastructure up and running at minimal cost and complication.

We started the ACCESS.MD project at the onset of our local covid-19 outbreak. Our initial target was to create an easy-to-deploy and self host community-local Telemedicine app for healthcare providers that do not have infrastructure to follow up with remote patients so they dont leave home.

Uses code from [HealthWatcher](https://github.com/YahyaOdeh/HealthWatcher) for Vitals Measurement and Reporting.
